            How a legacy enterprise fintech platform transitioned from scattered, inconsistent mockups 
            into a unified, scalable design language — one practical step at a time. 
            This was not a full redesign, but a strategic evolution that improved collaboration, quality, 
            and delivery speed across Product and Engineering.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Background</h2>

        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            Over several years, the product had grown feature by feature, team by team. 
            Each initiative brought new mockups—built with different tools, spacing rules, form layouts, 
            and interaction patterns. Nothing was deliberately inconsistent; the organization simply 
            didn't have a shared design foundation.
        </p>

        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            As the product matured and the pace increased, these inconsistencies began creating friction: 
            unclear handoffs, mismatched expectations, and mockups that didn’t always reflect the real product.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Challenge</h2>

        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            Different designers and product managers created mockups in different ways. 
            Engineering had no single source of truth for UI patterns. Meetings often began 
            with clarifying “what’s the real version?” instead of discussing solutions.
        </p>

        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            The team needed a consistent, shared design language—something lightweight, practical, 
            and easy for everyone to adopt without slowing delivery.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">01 — Auditing the Existing UI</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            I mapped out the most commonly used screens—billing, customer management, configuration—identifying 
            where inconsistencies created confusion or slowed development.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">02 — Creating a Shared Visual Language</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            I introduced Figma as our primary design environment and built a practical, lightweight component library: 
            buttons, form fields, table patterns, spacing rules, and layout structures—just enough to solve our most immediate needs.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">03 — Elevating Mockup Fidelity</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            With reusable components in place, mockups became clearer, higher fidelity, and far more aligned with the actual product. 
            Product managers could contribute content directly, and Engineering finally had a consistent reference.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">04 — Scaling Across New Features</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            As the design system stabilized, new features became faster to design and easier to review. 
            Instead of reinventing UI patterns for each project, I could focus on refining flows 
            and solving customer problems.

            This wasn’t a big-bang redesign—it was a steady, deliberate evolution. By introducing structure where it mattered, 
            we improved quality and collaboration without slowing delivery.
