        <p class="text-lg text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
            How an inherited Salesforce CPQ implementation was stabilized, streamlined, and expanded into a reliable quoting and contracting workflow. This was not a full re-implementation, but a systematic refinement of quoting, contract, and renewal processes to reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and support scalable sales operations.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Background</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            The organization had launched Salesforce CPQ through an external team, but as the business evolved, gaps began to appear. Multi-year term rules varied, approvals were handled manually, and renewal workflows weren’t automated.<br>
<br>


Sales reps relied heavily on Slack messages, emails, and workarounds to get quotes approved and contracts prepared, which introduced delays and inconsistencies.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
		CPQ was technically live, but not operationally optimized. Key Issues included:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
	<li>Inconsistent <strong>multi-year pricing</strong> and discount structures</li>
            <li><strong>Approval flows managed manually</strong> through Slack, email, or spreadsheets</li>
	<li><strong>Renewals that weren't automatically generated</strong>, required Sales Ops cleanup</li>
            <li><strong>No formal contact generation tool</strong>, leading to inconsistent documents</li>
			<li><strong>Limited workflow visibility</strong>, making it difficult to track where deals stalled</li>
  </ul>

        </p>
	<p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">Teams spent unnecessary time reconciling data and clarifying steps instead of moving deals forward.</p>

    <!-- Approach Section -->

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">My Approach</h2>
		<h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">01 - Diagnose & Map the Existing Workflow</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6"> I documented the full quote-to-contract process, including all rep touchpoints, approvals, handoffs, and renewal triggers.</p>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">          This surfaced misaligned logic, unclear ownership, and places where configuration didn’t support real workflows.</p>
		
		<h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">02 - Standardizing Quoting &amp; Term Logic </h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
      I stabilized CPQ by:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            <li>Standardized <strong>multi-year pricing rules</strong></li>
            <li>Aligned <strong>bundle components</strong> with Finance expectations</li>
            <li>Added guardrails to prevent invalid configurations</li>
            <li>Giving reps a predictable, repeatable quoting sequence</li>
      </ul>
		<p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">These improvements reduced the number of exceptions and approval escalations.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">03 - Introducing Structured Approvals &amp; Contract Generation</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
      To eliminate the manual approval and contract creation gaps:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            <li>I <strong>designed and documented</strong> the approval routing logic (discount, product, term–based)</li>
            <li>I partnered with a <strong>third-party integrator</strong> who performed the <strong>Conga Contracts development</strong></li>
            <li>I provided functional requirements, field mappings, and workflow diagrams</li>
            <li>I validated the templates and ensured they aligned with CPQ pricing and product logic</li>
      </ul>
		<p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">This introduced predictable approval paths and consistent contract output.</p>
        <div class="w-full h-64 bg-neutral-200 rounded-xl flex items-center justify-center text-neutral-500 text-sm mb-6">
         <img src="assets/salesforce-cpq-conga.jpg" width="1024" height="256" alt=""/></div>
	
	<h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">04 - Automating Renewals</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
      I worked across Sales Ops and Rev Ops to ensure:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            <li>Automatic renewal opportunities were created</li>
            <li>Terms and quantities rolled over accurately</li>
            <li>Amendments followed a consistent path</li>
            <li>Reps no longer had to manually create or correct renewal data</li>
        </ul>
		<p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">This increased renewal predictability and reduced Ops overhead.</p>
        <div class="w-full h-64 bg-neutral-200 rounded-xl flex items-center justify-center text-neutral-500 text-sm mb-6">
