            Over my tenure, I led the end-to-end UX for the company’s marketing and sales reporting platform, designing a centralized system that unified marketing campaigns, pipeline visibility, and lifecycle metrics. 
            By connecting Salesforce Account Engagement, Sales Engagement, campaigns, and dashboards, I provided a single source of truth for marketing and sales teams, enabling data-driven decisions across campaigns, pipeline, MQLs, SQLs, and customer lifecycle stages.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            Data was siloed across HubSpot and Salesforce, making it difficult to understand campaign ROI, sales pipeline contributions, and the full customer lifecycle. 
            Teams lacked a unified view, which slowed decision-making, limited visibility into MQLs, SQLs, and pipeline performance, and prevented accurate reporting.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">My Approach</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            I mapped existing marketing and sales workflows, identified gaps, and conducted interviews with marketing, sales operations, and executives. 
            Stakeholders needed a unified, actionable view where campaign performance, pipeline, and lifecycle metrics were accessible in real time.

        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            I ensured that visualizations and dashboards were actionable, scalable, and aligned with business objectives. 
            Regular feedback sessions and iterative improvements refined the system for both marketing and sales stakeholders.
