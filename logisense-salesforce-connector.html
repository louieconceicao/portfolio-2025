          When this project began, the company found itself at a pivotal moment. Their customers relied heavily on Salesforce, 
            yet every integration required custom API development which was costly, brittle, and inaccessible to the people who needed it most. 
           Instead of empowering sales teams, the process slowed them down. I saw an opportunity to reshape that experience from the ground up. </p>

    <!-- Problem Section -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-0 py-16 border-t border-neutral-200">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
          Every customer implementation was starting from zero. If a sales team wanted Salesforce and the enterprise billing solution provider to work together, 
            they needed a developer, either in-house or outsourced, to stitch APIs together. These integrations often broke, 
           causing inconsistent billing data and endless operational headaches. </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
          The experience wasn’t just inefficient, it was undermining trust. Sales leaders wanted a seamless subscription workflow inside Salesforce. 
            Admins needed predictable syncing behaviors. And the enterprise billing solution provider needed a way to deliver this without building everything customer by customer. 
          A native Salesforce app wasn’t just a feature; it was a strategic necessity.</p>
</section>

    <!-- Approach Section -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-0 py-16 border-t border-neutral-200">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">My Approach</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
          I started by stepping into the shoes of everyone involved, sales teams, admins, support staff, and implementation consultants. 
            Through interviews and shadowing sessions, a pattern quickly emerged, people weren’t asking for more features, 
            they were asking for clarity, reliability, and control.
      </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
          With these insights, I led the creation of a streamlined Salesforce native configuration experience. 
            My goal was to give admins a sense of empowerment, clear mapping rules, straightforward setup flows, and 
            predictable syncing behaviors that didn't require a developer lurking in the background.
      </p>
<p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
      I collaborated closely with an external development team, translating business requirements into technical specifications 
      and managing sprints in an agile cadence. Every week, I performed QA on deliverables, ensuring the sync logic, UI components, 
      and API interactions held up against real customer scenarios.

    <!-- Solution Section -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-0 py-16 border-t border-neutral-200">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Solution</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
        The result was the enterprise billing solution provider's first-ever Salesforce native integration app and an experience that finally met customers where they worked.</p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            <li>A clean, Salesforce native configuration UI that removed the need for custom code</li>
            <li>Clear sync rules and validation logic that protected data integrity</li>
            <li>Error handling states that made troubleshooting accessible for non technical teams</li>
            <li>Automated workflows for account, product, and subscription syncing</li>
            <li>A documented object mapping framework used by both customers and internal teams</li>
        </ul>
</section>

    <!-- Outcome Section -->
    <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-0 py-16 border-t border-neutral-200">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Outcome</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            The final product didn’t just reduce integration time, it transformed the onboarding experience entirely. 
            Sales teams could now manage subscriptions directly within Salesforce. Admins finally had visibility and control. 
            And for the enterprise billing solution provider, what was once a custom, inconsistent integration became a scalable product offering.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-6">
            Most importantly, the connector shifted customer perception. Instead of fighting the limitations of APIs, 
            teams felt supported, empowered, and confident that their data would stay in sync.
        </p>
<p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl italic">
      The app is now live on the Salesforce AppExchange, providing customers with a reliable, intuitive integration 
      that no longer requires a developer to maintain.
